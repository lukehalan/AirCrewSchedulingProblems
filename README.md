# Air Crew Scheduling Problems 

Solving Air Crew Scheduling Problems using Genetic Algorithms

## Aim:

You are required to implement a binary genetic algorithm to solve three airline crew scheduling problems. We will follow [1] to implement several specific operators such as initialisation, mutation and refinement operators to obtained good results. We will also implement the stochastic ranking method [2] for constraint handling. The problems we will solve are sppnw41, sppnw42 and sppnw43 in OR-Library:
